    "**Problem statement**  \n",
    "    When pigs are exposed to a severe short-term stressor,  their metabolism and body temperature increases. If this occurs just prior to slaughter, the pigs will be exsanguinated while their metabolism and body temperature are still high. Thus the students of OLFU find a solution to solve such task that doesn't involve human interaction but throught Artificial Intelligence\n",

    "In this notebook, I hope to show how a data scientist would go about working through a problem. The goal is to correctly predict if a pig is stress.\n",
