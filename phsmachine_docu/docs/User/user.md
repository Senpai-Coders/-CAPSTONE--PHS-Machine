# Welcome to User's/Admin Guide
This will help user on how to navigate & operate the system.

## First time sign in
PHS developers will provide you the initial account which is **ROOT Account** for the system. This ROOT account is the highest level of authorization on the system and cannot be deleted. This root account is used to create & manage other accounts on the system.

## Creating An Account

PHS machine doesn't have a sign up / create account endpoint to ensure that nobody can create and account freely and get access to the system. The developers will provide you the password for the pre-existing **root** account on the system. Only the **ROOT** & **Admin** account has the ability to create other account. You must contact or ask someone who have access to the **ROOT** or **Admin** account on the PHS system to create your account. 

You can email PHSM developers below if you have question or problem about the root account.
